            <p>
                Prodigy was founded in 1995 by Steve Farmer after going to see the movie “Star Park” with his son and wanting to get him a collectible from the movie. There weren’t any toys available so he decided to go back to one of his childhood hobbies and make one himself. This birthed Prodigy Collectibles and has grown into one of the world’s most popular collectible companies.
